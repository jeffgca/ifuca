# Posta Feed

> An @proto feed generator prototype that produces a feed of posts that conform to a specific
> meta-thread convention common on bluesky.

If someone is posting to a specific type of quote-post thread on bluesky, this thread will ( hopefully ) capture that post. The posts this feed is specifically looking for are:

 * that *start with* the text 'if you see this, post a'.
 * include the hashtag '#posta'
